# Classification-of-Iris-datasets-using-SVM



Iris Flower:
In Iris dataset, there are three kind of species i.e., Setosa, Versicolorand *Virginica *and 50 samples on each species having their respective Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

In this project we will classify the Iris species based on their features such as Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width.

Motivation:
This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and to learn the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling and finally to build a machine learning model.
